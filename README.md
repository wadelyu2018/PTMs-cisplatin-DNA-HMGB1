# PTMs-cisplatin-DNA-HMGB1

Sequence alignment, structure templates, homology modeling log file, the modeled structure of the platinated DNA/protein complex without PTMs, and all simulated conformational ensemble data of the noPTM and A-D PTMs complexes.

The conformational ensemble data were clustered from full atomistic MD simulations, using the same clustering method and cutoff for all these systems.
The MD trajectories were obtained from REST2 enhanced sampling (see publication J. Phys. Chem. B, 2011, 115 (30), pp 9431–9438
for details), stored in a binary format (XTC).
These XTC files are in size of GB, please contact Wenping Lyu (wenping.lyu@rwth-aachen.de), to get access of these binary files.
