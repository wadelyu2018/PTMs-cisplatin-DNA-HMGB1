# PTMs-cisplatin-DNA-HMGB1

Homology modeled structure of the platinated DNA/protein complex without PTMs, and all simulated conformational ensemble data of the complexes.

The conformational ensemble data were clustered from full atomic MD simulations, using the same clustering method and cutoff for all these systems.
The MD trajectories were obtained from REST2 enhanced sampling (see publication XXX for details), stored in a binary format (XTC).
These trajectory files are in size of GB, please contact Wenping Lyu (wenping.lyu@rwth-aachen.de), to get access of these binary files.
